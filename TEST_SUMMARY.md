## Test Infrastructure

### Testing Framework
- **Testing Library**: Go's built-in `testing` package

- **HTTP Testing**: `net/http/httptest`

### Test Categories
1. **Unit Tests**: Fast, isolated tests for individual functions
2. **Integration Tests**: API endpoint testing with mocked dependencies
3. **Database Tests**: Database interaction testing with SQL mocks
4. **RBAC Tests**: Comprehensive role-based access control validation

## Test Execution

### Available Commands
```bash
# Run all tests
make test

### Role-Based Access Control Tests
- **Admin**: Full system access
- **Property Manager**: Property and tenant management
- **Tenant**: Own data access only
- **Viewer**: Read-only access
- **Unauthenticated**: Public endpoints only

## Security Testing

### Covered Security Aspects
- SQL injection prevention (through parameterized queries)
- Authentication bypass attempts
- Authorization escalation prevention
- Cross-user data access protection
- Input validation and sanitization
